## What is Mainly PvP?
Mainly PvP is a minecraft resourcepack made for player combat in sub 1.9 minecraft versions (mainly for **1.7.10** and **1.8.9**). The main goal for this resource pack is to still keep things *vanilla* like, while making them better :).

This pack contains a lot of "*oily*" textures (wool, endstone, wood, clay etc.) which are made using multiple batch convert filters in **[XnView MP](https://xnview.com)**, which is an awesome multi platform software for managing images.
